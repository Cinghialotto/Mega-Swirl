<<< WHAT IS THE GENESIS IMAGE ASSET? >>>

Genesis Image Asset (GIA) is a file format used for image assets in Sega
Megadrive/Genesis games and applications.

<<< FILE FORMAT >>>

As an overview, the file consists of a header and the image data. All values are
Big-Endian format (as the Motorola 68000 is Big-Endian.)

Header:
	
*	uint32_t	magicNumber
	The magic number identifying the image format. This shall be the 32-bit
	value 0xB16D1CC5.
	
	Example: [ B1 6D 1C C5 ] - Specify a valid GIA file.
	
*	uint8_t		compression
	The type of compression used in the image.
	
	Valid Values:
	00 - No compression
	01 - 4bpp RLE compression
	
	Example: See above.
	
*	uint8_t		order
	Whether or not the image is sprite-ordered or tile-ordered. 

	Valid values:
	00 - Sprite order
	01 - Tile order
	
	Example: See above.
	
*	uint8_t		xSegments
	The number of 8x8 tiles in this image in the X direction. This means that
	every image in the X direction must be a multiple of 8.
	
	Example: [ 01 ] - The image is 8 pixels across (one tile across).
	
*	uint8_t		ySegments
	The number of 8x8 tiles in this image in the Y direction. This means that
	every image in the Y direction must be a multiple of 8.
	
	Example: [ 04 ] - The image is 32 pixels down (four tiles down).

*	uint32_t		metadataOffset
	The offset of the metadata (usually after the image).
	If 0, there is no metadata.
	
	Example: [ 00 00 FF FF ] - The metadata is at file offset 65535.
	
Image Palette:

*	uint16_t*		imagePalette
	Sixteen 16-bit unsigned integers representing colours 0 through 15. The
	lower three nibbles are used as 0x0BGR.
	
Image Format:

	Image always starts at offset 44.

	- No compression: The image is loaded in 8x8 tile segments, which may
	be typecast right onto a uint32_t array. Every eight uint32_t's, a
	new tile starts. Each nibble is a pixel. This format is directly usable
	by the Sega Genesis VDP. The ordering is selected based on
	compressionOptions.
	
	- RLE compression: Instructions are given to assemble 8x8 tile segments
	one tile at a time. 
	
Metadata:

*	uint8_t*		metadataName
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the name field.
	
*	uint8_t*		metadataAuthor
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the author field.
	
*	uint8_t*		metadataDescription
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the description field.
