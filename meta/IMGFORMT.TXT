<<< WHAT IS THE GENESIS IMAGE ASSET? >>>

Genesis Image Asset (GIA) is a file format used for image assets in Sega
Megadrive/Genesis games and applications.

<<< FILE FORMAT >>>

As an overview, the file consists of a header and the image data. All values are
Big-Endian format (as the Motorola 68000 is Big-Endian.)

Header:
	
*	uint32_t	magicNumber
	The magic number identifying the image format. This shall be the 32-bit
	value 0xB16D1CC5.
	
	Example: [ B1 6D 1C C5 ] - Specify a valid GIA file.
	
*	uint8_t		compressionOptions
	The type of compression used in the image. Additionally, whether or not
	the image is sprite-ordered or tile-ordered. The lower nibble is used for
	the compression flag: the upper nibble is used for the ordering.
	
	Valid Values:
	00 - Tile order, no compression.
	01 - Tile order, 4bpp RLE compression.
	10 - Sprite order, no compression.
	11 - Sprite order, 4bpp RLE compression.
	
	Lower nibble is reserved for up to fifteen different types of compression.
	
	Example: See above.
	
*	uint8_t		xSegments
	The number of 8x8 tiles in this image in the X direction. This means that
	every image in the X direction must be a multiple of 8.
	
	Example: [ 01 ] - The image is 8 pixels across (one tile across).
	
*	uint8_t		ySegments
	The number of 8x8 tiles in this image in the Y direction. This means that
	every image in the Y direction must be a multiple of 8.
	
	Example: [ 04 ] - The image is 32 pixels down (four tiles down).

Metadata:

*	uint16_t		metadataSize
	The size of the metadata header. If zero, there is no metadata.
	
	Example: [ 00 FF ] - The metadata is 255 bytes.
	
*	uint8_t*		metadataName
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the name field.
	
*	uint8_t*		metadataAuthor
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the author field.
	
*	uint8_t*		metadataDescription
	A null-terminated sequence of characters representing the description field.
	
Image Palette:

*	uint16_t*		imagePalette
	Sixteen 16-bit unsigned integers representing colours 0 through 15. The
	lower three nibbles are used as 0x0BGR.
